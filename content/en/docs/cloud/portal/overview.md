## View Your Darcy Cloud Edge Project

Once your account has been created, Darcy Cloud automatically creates your first project. This may
take a few minutes. The screen will refresh automatically when complete.

Once your Edge project is created, you will see your project overview page and be able
to [add your first node!](nodes/get-started-add-node.md).
