# Applications

Darcy connects to your Applications to interact and share data. Applications can be configured in the Darcy Cloud platform to connect to one or more edge nodes. Apps are defined using YAML files and can be deployed and updated by uploading those YAML files. Darcy nodes can be set up to interact with applications, process information, and move data between multiple apps.

## Application Components <a href="#touchpoints" id="touchpoints"></a>

Darcy can connect to virtually any containerized application. Weâ€™ve outlined the touchpoints for connecting to an application below.

### Microservices <a href="#microservices" id="microservices"></a>

Darcy nodes connect directly to your applications' microservices to send, retrieve, and parse data. Many microservices are hosted in Docker or similar containerized services. Microservices a within the Application YAML specification to

More information on connecting to your microservice **** [**here**](microservice.md)**.**

### Integrations <a href="#integrations" id="integrations"></a>

#### Endpoints and Ports <a href="#endpoints-and-ports" id="endpoints-and-ports"></a>

Darcy connects to REST API Endpoints and TCP Ports. You can specify the port within the Application YAML. For more information, please refer to the Public Services page.&#x20;

#### Routing <a href="#routing" id="routing"></a>

Applications may contain microservices on more than one node. When this happens, it may be required to set up message routing. Routing is set up to transmit data from one instance of your application to another. Routing is configured within the Application YAML.&#x20;

```yaml
routes:
- name: monitor-to-viewer
  from: monitor
  to: viewer
```

&#x20;More information on routing can be found in the [**Application Templating**](app-doc-advanced-templating.md) page.

### Variables <a href="#variables" id="variables"></a>

Variables can be defined on application inputs and outputs to be processed alongside Darcy nodes and adjacent applications. More information on declaring and using variables can be found here.

## Creating and Managing Applications

### Creating an Application

Applications can be created within the Darcy platform by creating a YAML configuration file linking to your existing containerized application. The steps for creating and deploying a custom application in Darcy can be found [**here**](../get-started-ec/deploy-a-custom-app.md).

### Deploying a Demo App

Darcy provides a demo application you can deploy within minutes to see an example of an Application in action. You need one node live in order to deploy the demo app. More information on deploying the app can be found [**here**](../get-started-ec/heart-rate-demo-application/get-started-deploy-app.md).

### Managing your Application

\
Applications can be managed through the [**portal**](../get-started-ec/heart-rate-demo-application/get-started-deploy-app.md#deploy-a-custom-app-using-the-portal) or using [**edgectl**](../get-started-edgectl/#deploy-an-application)**.**
